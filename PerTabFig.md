### a.	Case notification for all TB cases -2000 to 2013

#### i.	National - by type of TB cases (new smear positive, new smear negative, EP, relapse and re-treatment cases) annually

### c.	Casefinding

#### i.	National - Number of TB symptomatics examined by smear microscopy by year 

#### ii.	Regional - Number of TB symptomatics examined by smear microscopy by year 
(Should this be per population to make it comparable?)
